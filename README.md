<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
<!-- EXCLUDE PROJECT SCREENSHOT

GifSync started out as a simple question: "How do I get [Hat Kid][a-hat-in-time] to dance to my music while I stream?" The answer to this question quickly turned into a long and convoluted dive into APIs, gif frame-times, and web servers.

However, through the power of **THE INTERNET!!** (and a ton of duck-duck-go'ing) I was able to pull it off with as best of accuracy as I could. Best of all, it works with any gif! I wanted to share this with others so that no matter what your experience level is in programming, you too can experience gifs that dance to your music in real time.
